Implementation notes for "Acid-Base Solutions" (acid-base-solutions)

This is a port of the Java version of acid-base-solutions.

There is no model-view transform between the model and view portions of this sim. 
The transform is implicitly 1:1, with identical coordinate frames.
One unit of distance in the model is one unit of distance in the play area.
Positive x is to the right, positive y is down.

For a description of the model, see model.txt.
